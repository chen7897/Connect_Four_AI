# Connect Four AI
Chen Sabag
## Description
This is a Connect Four game where the player can play against an AI. The AI will use different algorithms (Minimax, Genetic Algorithm, etc.) to play the game and improve over time.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/chen7897/Connect_Four_AI`
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pygame numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage
Run the game with:
```
python game.py
```

## AI Algorithms
1. **Minimax**: A decision-making algorithm used for two-player games to find the optimal move.
2. **Genetic Algorithm**: An evolutionary algorithm to improve AI performance over time by simulating natural selection.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pygame
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
